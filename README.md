# Freedom House Freedom in the World Dataset with UCIMerge Numeric IDs

This project aligns the Freedom House measure of democracy with the [UCIMerge](https://github.com/mpearce/UCIMerge) numeric country ID. This numeric ID should make it easier to merge Freedom House data with the country IDs of other international comparative datasets.

Original datasets are available here: https://freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-world

The source files used to compile these measures are included in this archive.
